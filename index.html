		<p> This whole idea was inspired by my favorite YouTube group <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfi-mPMOmche6WI-jkvnGXw" target="_blank">Good Good</a> . They have made me want to be a better golfer #1, but they have also inspired me to become a business owner and the dream would be to one day be able to sell their merchandise in my bar.</p>
